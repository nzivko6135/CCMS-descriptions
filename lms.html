        <div class="card-description">A leave management system is a process within an organization that determines how leave is requested by employees and approved by managers, as well as how it is tracked for payroll, balance, and other purposes. It leads to better communication, organized employee leave calendar, time efficiency, and real time updates. You are able to add in Public Holidays for the year and upload them into the page. When clicking on “Manage My Leave”, you are directed to “My LMS Record Details”, “Apply Leave”, “Manage Leave History”, and “Compensation Details”. For “My LMS Record Details” this allows the user to add in their earned PTO hours, eligible monthly hours, earned compensation hours, and PTO cap hours. To “Apply Leave” you must fill in the start date you are leaving and the end date which you are coming back, as well as the type of leave and the reason for the leave. “Manage Leave History” lets the user track their leave record and the “Compensation Details” lets them track their compensation record.</div>
